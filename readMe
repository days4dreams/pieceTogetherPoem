Playing with loops in C#. Can you figure out what poemBlock will print? /* Practise for reading for and while loops */


Each button triggers an action.
The result of the action is the update of the myLabel TextBlock.

Each of the four event handlers contain a method;
Button1 runs a simple math calculation and returns the output to the TextBlock
Button2 contains an if/else statement that checks an integer variable called x to see if it’s equal to 10.
Button3 contains a conditional test.
Button4 contains two loops; the first is a while loop, which repeats the statements inside the brackets as long as the condition is true (do something while this is true). The second one is a for loop. 
Button5 concatenates a string into a sentence using loops.

Can you figure out what poemBlock will print?

// EXAMPLE ONE STARTS

int x = 0;
            string poem = "";

            while ( x < 4)
            {
                poem = poem + "a";

                if (x < 1)
                {
                    poem = poem + " ";
                }

                poem = poem + "n";

                if (x > 1)
                {
                    poem = poem + " oyster";
                    x = x + 2;
                }

                if (x == 1)
                {
                    poem = poem + "noys ";
                }

                if ( x < 1)
                {
                    poem = poem + "oise ";
                }

                x = x + 1;
            }
            poemBlock.Text = poem;

//ENDS

//EXAMPLE TWO STARTS

string result = “”;
int x = 3;
// declare an empty string, assign x the value of 3

while (x > 0) 
{
//whilst x is greater than 0, do this

  If (x > 2) {
  result = result + “a”;
  }
// test if x is greater than 2. The first time though, x is equal to 3, so the condition is true.

  x = x - 1;
  result = result + “-“;
//this statement makes x equal to 2 the first time through and 1 the second time through (no further conditionals)

  If (x ==2) {
  result = result + “b c”;
  }

  If (x ==1) {
  result = result + “d”;
  x = x -1;
  }

} //end while loop

Output.text = result;
// ENDS

Running the loop;

x = 3 , result reads “”.
While statement tests if x is greater than 0, this is true, so continues.
If statement tests is x is greater 2, this is true, so statement runs.
Results becomes “a”.
1 is deducted from x, x = 2.
- is added to result, Result becomes “a-“.
If statement tests if x is equal to 2, this is true, to statement runs.
Result becomes “a-b c”.
If statement tests if x is equal to 1, this is false. 
One loop complete. Return to top of loop. *loop continues to test until statement is false*
While statement tests if x is greater than 0, this is true, so continues.
If statement tests is x is greater 2, this is false, statement does not run.
1 is deducted from x, x = 1.
- is added to result, Result becomes “a-b c-“.
If statement tests if x is equal to 2, this is false, statement does not run.
If statement tests if x is equal to 1, this is true, statement runs.
d is added to result, result becomes “a-b c-d”.
1 is deducted from x, x = 0.
Two loops complete. Return to top of loop. *loop continues to test until statement is false*
While statement tests if x is greater than 0, this is false, so exits loop.
Output prints result to screen.
